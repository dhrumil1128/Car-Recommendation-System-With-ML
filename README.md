## Features  
- **Data Exploration:** Analyze and understand the dataset to identify patterns and relationships between car features.  
- **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommend cars based on user input criteria such as seating capacity, fuel type, price range, and more.  
- **Web Application Interface:** Provide a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction.  
- **Real-Time Suggestions:** Generate car recommendations instantly as users provide their preferences.
